Here you can find some programms and algoritms, which help main algoritm works more powerful and qualitatively. Also some programms helps to find several metrics and things for futher researching.

### Per_difference
This utilit are waiting a percentage difference between real plot of student's raiting and plot, which was generated by our math model. It is neccassery to understand our machine learning raiting process also it would be a quality metric for several reports.  
__________
### Annealing-emitation
One of the optimization algoritms. This method is neccasery to realize math models faster, but with worse quality. Our file has tho wersions of annealing emitation: 2D- models process and 3D- models process. You can see details and code, and also change parametres in [annealing-emitation_code].
